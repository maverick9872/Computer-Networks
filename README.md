|----------------------------->For sampleclient-sampleserver files:
                |----------------------------->1)Run sampleserver file in python
                |----------------------------->2)Run sampleclient file in python
                |----------------------------->3)Understand the basic code in the server and client and trace them to see the output
                |----------------------------->**CAUTION : The code crashes if you type anything apart from the expected input from the server,
                                                           refer to the if conditions stated within the server code to see the accepted responses,
                                                           I'll be delighted to see how this code evolves in this community as it's one of my first
